Conjecture: for {p,q} = {3,q}, for every q = 3^n, n = 0,1,2.., there is only one root, q.

For {p,q}  = {5,1}, the algo breaks down (appears to) at 7 - it doesn't converge. Can we work out why?

for p=3, q=3^r, there is one root of value r
for p=3, one root will be q, with frequency at least 1/q.
=> when n=k*q, k is an integer, odd numbers will turn into an even multiple of q, i.e. all members in the sequence maintain
being a multiple of q. So IF a value does converge, it WILL converge to a root of q. And multiples of q occur 1/q of the time.

for q=15, 21, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 87, 93, 99
      5x3, 7x3, 11x3, 13x3, 5x3^2, 17x3, 19x3, 7x3^2, 23x3, 25x3, 29x3, 31x3, 11x3^2
...for q = 3y = (3^n)*z, where y is odd and z are the prime factors excluding 3, numbers will have a root of q occurring 1/z of the time.
e.g. for q = 15 = 3x5, numbers will have a root of 15 1/5 (a fifth) of the time.
for q = 27 = 1x3^2, numbers will have a root of 27 1/1 (ALL) of the time.

(3n+1) * 57 = (3n+1) * 3*19

3n*19 + 3*19 = 19*(3n+3)
3n*5 + 45 = 3n*5 + 9*5 = (n+3) * 3 * 5
Why does every multiple of 5 have a root of 45 when q=45?
(why does every multiple of 1 have a root of 3^r when q=3^r)

QUESTIONS:
What q values have a root of 1? Why? (Like 3x+5. Note, the frequency of roots appears well distributed through the numbers, given the 1m and 10m trials runs look like they have the same distribution).
