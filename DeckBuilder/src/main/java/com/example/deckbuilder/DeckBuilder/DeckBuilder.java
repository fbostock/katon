     * Main TODO List
     * 1) create a frame with 5 "cards" in the middle, a row below for ships, a row below that for cards played, and a row below
     * that to represent your hand.
     * Similarly, above there will be rows for the opponent. Start with an AI.
     *
     * 2) Have a Menu screen, with option to start game. Clicking that loads the screen in step 1).
     * 3) Create hands for the game, picking a random selection of cards for the player deck.
     * 4) Add a hover effect over a card in the player's hand to identify it as playable.
     * 5) "Play a card". When player clicks a card, it fires an event to the game engine. Create a game engine.
     * 6) Game engine takes the event with the card, and fires an event to add card to gui, and updates model. The
     * model includes the cards the other has in their hand, and in play during their turn. And eventually ships.
     * 7) Update model with card played, updating any money player has other properties. Use basic cards from Alpha deck
     * in trello.
